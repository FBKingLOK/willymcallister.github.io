# Draft 

Electricity begins with *electric force*. We explain electric force by saying there is something called *charge*, a property of matter. 

* Will be replaced with the ToC

### Where we're headed 
{:.no_toc}

* A good way to understand charge is to follow its historical development. You will learn why the idea of charge came about, and how historical twists created some oddities that we still get to deal with as electrical engineers. 

* We explain the existence of an electric force by saying that objects have *charge*. We don't know why this force exists, but we can describe it and harness it for our own needs.

* There are two types of charge. Ben Franklin gave us the names we use for charge. He called the two types Plus and Minus. The same (like) charges repel each other, and different (unlike) charges attract each other.

* Charles Augustin de Coulomb worked out how the electric force works. His experiment showed that the size of the electric force is proportional to the product of the two charges involved $(q_1, q_2)$, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges. This is called Coulomb's Law.

    $F_e \propto \dfrac{q_1 \, q_2}{r^2}$

* The smallest unit of charge exists in two sub-atomic particles, the electron $(-)$ and the proton $(+)$. The amount of charge is identical, with opposite signs. The assignment of $-$ and $+$ traces its history back to Ben Franklin, based on experiments he did 150 years prior to the discovery of the electron.

* You can specify a specific amount of charge in two ways, in units of coulombs or as a number of electron charges. 

* The international standard unit for an amount of charge is the coulomb. The standard defines $1 \,\text{coulomb} =$ the amount of charge that moves past a point when the current is $1\,\text{ampere}$. 

* The charge on an electron, $e^-$, is this tiny number of coulombs: $0.00000000000000000016021766208$ coulombs. We can write this in scientific notation more simply: $e^- = 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs. Turning this around, we can express a coulomb in terms of the charged contained in some number  of electrons, $e^-$. One coulomb is the combined charge of $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.

## Eels and amber

Let's start at the very beginning, like 5000 years ago. For the moment, pretend you never heard of charge or electricity, and forget you know anything about atoms. 

Around 5000 years ago, the Egyptians knew that if you touched an eel it could give you a shock. They didn't know why it happened, but they used to tell sick people to touch eels to make them feel better. This very first practical application of electricity was in medicine.

Back in those days, the Greeks made jewelry out of a pretty stone called amber. Amber isn't really a stone, it is fossilized resin from trees. Resin is a goopy substance trees make as a defense mechanism to fight off insects and cover wounds like when a branch gets broken. When this goopy stuff drips from the tree it might eventually turn into a solid and get the name amber. Amber is basically nature's version of plastic.

So Egyptian or Greek aristocrats wearing their amber jewelry would pet their cats. They noticed light things like feathers or their own hair were attracted to the amber. Today we have a fancy official word for it, the *triboelectric effect*. "Tribo-" is the Greek word for "rub", so you can call it the ["rubbing-electric" effect]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _videos/triboelectric-effect.md %}).

You can create the same effect by running a plastic comb through your dry hair, or rubbing a balloon on your sweater.

The Greek word for amber is ἤ λ ε κ τ ρ ο ν.

I bet you can guess what we use this word for. 

## Making sense of electric force

So we have these observations of nature: rubbing cats or balloons. We observe this wierd force, sometimes attraction, sometimes repulsion, depending on what rubbed against what. So from the very beginning we could tell there were two kinds of electric force, attraction and repulsion. Wierdest of all, it seems like the force acts at a distance: The two objects don't have to be touching, but yet we see this obvious pushing or pulling force between them. This is super strange (and super fascinating).  

<details>
<summary>Is rubbing cats the same as magnetism?</summary>
<p>This rubbing force seems kind of like magnetism, which has the same <em>force at a distance</em> property. But electric force has to come from a different place. Magnetism is a property of certain kinds of rocks called lodestones (a rock that contains iron). This electric force comes from the friction between amber and cat and has nothing to do with iron.

Later in your study of electrical engineering or physics, you will learn that electricity and magnetism are very closely related and intertwined. When these ideas come together it's called *electromagnetism*, which is responsible for light and radio waves. 
</p>
<p>Gravity also does the same force-at-a-distance thing, but it, too, is a very different kind of force.
</p>
</details>

The best explanation anyone has come up with (so far) to explain electric force is: Physical objects (matter) displaying this electric force do this because they possess a property called **charge**. 

<details>
<summary>What is a "property" of matter? 
</summary>
<p>Matter has a number of properties: its mass, color, volume, squishyness. These properties are not little things that are inside the matter, they are asects of the matter itself. When an object attracts or repels other nearby objects we say it is because it has the property of *charge*. Charge is not some little tiny piece of stuff tucked inside electrons and protons, it is a property of those particles.

## Do we know what charge is?

Great! Now we know why there is electric force. It's because objects have charge! So what is charge? Uhh...

To this day, we have no idea why this rub-the-cat electric force exists, just like we don't know why gravity exists. It just does. Saying it is caused by charge is the story we made up to make us feel like we know what's going on. Whether charge is real or not, using this explanation leads us in the right direction for understanding electrictiy. The whole "acting at a distance" thing is so puzzling and never made anyone happy, but it is the best story we have for now. 

Fortunately, we are certain electric force exists. That's for sure. And we've come up with a good way to describe how it works in the real world (Coulomb's Law). Best of all, we've come up with all sorts of cool things we can do with it. That is what electrcial engineers do. We make useful stuff because we understand the effects of charge and electric force. Electrical engineers can't explain the "why's" any better than physicists or philosoplers, but we are especially good at building things that exploit charge and electric force.

## Ben Franklin

In 1752 Ben Franklin nearly killed himself while flying a kite in a thunderstorm. He showed that lightning was made of electricity. He could tell because the key attached to the wet kite string gave off sparks, the same as if you shuffled your feet on the carpet an touched a door knob.

Franklin thought of electricity as an invisible electric fluid. While doing rubbing experiments he felt like rubbing one object caused it to lose invisible fluid while the other object gained fluid. Franklin coined the word *charge* and gave us the names of the two charges, "positive" and "negative". 

<details>
<summary>What's in a name?</summary>
<p>The names $+$ and $-$ made sense. If you let equal amounts of the two charges come together you get zero charge (neutral). This aspect of charge dan be described by positive and negative numbers. But Franklin could have chosen another pair of words instead of the signs we use for numbers. Like maybe "in" and "out".  After all, the poles of a magnet are not $+$ and $-$, they are called North and South. In some ways I wish he had picked different names. The choice of number sign names for charge causes a bit of confusion when we define the direction of current flow in a little while.</p>

<p>Franklin coined several electrical terms: battery, charge, conductor, plus, minus, condenser (another name for a capacitor). </p>
</details>

So now we have a name for this electricity stuff. What's next?

## Charles Augustin de Coulomb

Even if we can't explain *why* there is electric force, we can describe *what it does*. The first person to do a good job of this, using the concept of charge, was French physicist [Charles Augustin de Coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb), in 1784. (30 years after Franklin, and still 113 years before the discovery of the electron in 1897 by [J.J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron#Discovery).) So Coulomb was working with the idea of charge without knowing about electrons or protons or even atoms.

Coulomb invented a very sensitive instrument to measure electric force, a *torsion balance*. He did a bunch of experiments putting different amounts and signs of charge on two spheres and measuring the electric force between them.

<details>
<summary>Coulomb's torsion balance image</summary>
<p>The torsion balance is based on twisting a fine wire. It works just like if you hang a tire from a tree with a rope. If you sit in the tire it takes only a very small push to start you twisting back-and-forth. Eventually you come to a stop.</p>
<p>Coulomb drew his torsion balance for a publication.
<img src="/i/0-5torsion_balance1.png" alt="Coulomb's torsion balance" >
</p>
<p> Figure 1: Two spheres are placed inside a chamber. The slightly larger sphere on the left sits still, while the smaller sphere is mounted on an arm (P) hanging from the thin torsion wire. The cylindrical glass chamber is sealed to keep air currents from messing up the measurement. It is made of glass so you can see what's going on inside. Before closing the chamber, a charge is placed on the smaller sphere. The larger fixed sphere starts out not charged. The smaller hanging sphere swings back and forth and finally comes to rest at some position. Then charge is placed on the larger sphere by touching the post holding it up (see Figure 5), held in place by the clamp that looks like chopsticks. This causes the hanging sphere to rotate towards or away from the larger sphere, depending on the sign of both charges. The amount of twist is measured on the scale (Q) going around the chamber. The other figures are close-up views of the important bits of the main instrument.</p>
</details>

Coulomb didn't know about atoms or charged electrons, and he did not have very good control over exactly how much charge was applied to the spheres. So his reasoning had to have been somewhat abstract. One sphere had "some charge" and was attracted to the other sphere that had "some charge". He was quite smart about how he applied the charge. For example, you start with two balloons with no charge. You can tell they are uncharged because they don't attract or repel anything. Now charge up one balloon by rubbing it on your sweater. It now has some amount of charge, let's call it $q$ charge. ($Q$ or $q$ are the variable names Coulomb used for charge, and we still do today.) Now, if you touch the charged balloon to the uncharged balloon, they will share $q$ between them. You end up with two balloons each charged the same, $q/2$. Now you can do experiments with $q/2$ balloons. 

Splitting charges like this, Coulomb demonstrated that the force is proportional to the amount of charge on each object and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them $(1/r^2)$. We call it Coulomb's Law. 

$F \propto \dfrac{q_1\,q_2}{r^2}$

The $propto$ symbol means "proportional to". We go into a lot more detail in [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering/ee-electrostatics/ee-electric-force-and-electric-field/a/ee-electric-force). 

Check out this charming 1959 educational video where Professor Eric Rogers from Princeton University demonstrates electric force. You can see him transfer charge from his "charging arrangement" machine to one balloon and then sharing that charge with another.

## The coulomb - unit of charge

Electrical scientists needed a way to talk about an amount of charge. The unit of charge was named the coulomb, in honoor of guess who. The first definition of charge (before anyone knew about electrons) was

$1\,\text{coulomb}$ is the amount of charge that flows by in $1\,\text{second}$ when the current is $1\,\text{ampere}$.

That's the same as saying $1\,\text{coulomb} = 1 A \cdot s$. $A \cdot s$ is an "amp second".

I think of a coulomb of charge like it is a bucket of water or sand. I can understand how much water or sand that is without knowing that water or sand is made of atoms.

##Electron

These days, we know the smallest unit of charge exists in two sub-atomic particles, the electron $(-)$ and the proton $(+)$. The amount of charge is identical, with opposite signs. The mass of electron and proton differ by $1000\times$, but their charge is identical. Nature made it that way. 

A very noticeable thing about electric force is that it is large, far greater than the force of gravity. Unlike gravity, however, there are two types of electric charge. Opposite types of charge attract, and like types of charge repel. Gravity has only one type: it only attracts, never repels.


## Coulomb
from KA learner ccmiint
First lets look at the coulomb then we will look at the ampere. Because electrons are so small and it would be difficult to measure individually, we have put 6.28 billion billion electrons into a unit called a coulomb. I like to think of it as a gallon of water. There are a lot of individual water molecules in a gallon, and you could imagine it would be impossible to measure water by molecules. So a gallon is just a convenient, and a standard measurement of all those billions of individual water molecules just like the coulomb is for electrons. And the ampere is a rate which is equal to 1 coulomb per second or 6.28 billion billion electrons moving past a point per second. So in terms of water, one gallon of water moving past a point per second.

* The charge on an electron is a tiny unwieldy number. $0.00000000000000000016021766208$ coulombs. Rather than writing all those zeros—and getting it wrong most of the time—we can use scientific notation to write the number more simply: $1.6021766208 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs. 

<p>
<details>
<summary> What is a coulomb?</summary>
<p>The <strong>coulomb</strong> is the Système International d'Unités (SI) unit for an amount of charge. $1$ coulomb of charge flows past a point in a wire in one second when the current in the wire is $1$ ampere.
$1 \,\text{coulomb} = 1 \,\text{ampere flowing for} \, 1 \,\text{second}$</p>

<p>In terms of electrons, $e^-$, one coulomb is the combined charge of $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.
</p>

The unit of charge is the coulomb [C], which is the amount of charge transferred by one ampère of current in one second [As]. It is an unusually large unit for most day-to-day applications. Fractions of a coulomb, like microcoulombs [µC] and nanocoulombs [nC], are more common.
