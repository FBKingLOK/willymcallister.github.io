<h1 id="electrical-engineering">Electrical Engineering</h1>
<p>Created by Willy McAllister, 2016 Electrical Engineering Content Fellow at Khan Academy</p>
<h2 id="preparing-to-study-electrical-engineering">Preparing to study electrical engineering</h2>
<p>Become familiar with the two most important electrical quantities: current and voltage. Learn about engineering numbers, units, and notation. Read a summary of the math and science preparation that will help you have the best experience studying electrical engineering.</p>
<h2 id="circuit-analysis">Circuit analysis</h2>
<p>Circuit analysis is the process of finding all the currents and voltages in a network of connected components. We look at the basic elements used to build circuits, and find out what happens when elements are connected together into a circuit.</p>
<h3 id="circuit-elements">Circuit elements</h3>
<p>The basic elements of circuit design are components (resistors, capacitors, and inductors), and sources (voltage and current). We talk about both ideal elements and real-world objects. We develop precise terminology for how to talk about circuits.</p>
<h3 id="circuits-with-resistors">Circuits with resistors</h3>
<p>Series and parallel resistors, delta-wye networks, and the voltage divider.</p>
<h3 id="dc-circuit-analysis">DC circuit analysis</h3>
<p>Find the state of a DC circuit by applying Kirchhoff's Laws. The node voltage method, mesh current method, and loop current method.</p>
<h3 id="natural-and-forced-response">Natural and forced response</h3>
<p>Circuits with capacitors and inductors change with time. The natural and forced response of RC, RL, and RLC circuits. Uses calculus.</p>
<h3 id="ac-circuit-analysis">AC circuit analysis</h3>
<p>If we limit ourselves to signals shaped like sines or cosines, we can develop a whole method of AC analysis to figure out what happens in circuits with any changing signal. These methods are far simpler than solving a differential equation from scratch.</p>
