Here are some tips on how to print an article or generate a .pdf file from Spinning Numbers...

The articles print nicely straight out of your browser. You probably want to reduce the print scale down to around 80% of full size to get a nice result. 

Start by setting the scale to 80% in your browser's File: Print dialog box.

### Example: Mac running Chrome

This is what the Print dialog box looks like on Mac running the Chrome browser. Your browser will have something similar.

The Print dialog opens like this. The default scale is 100%. At this scale, the article prints a little too big.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link i/printing-1.png %})

Open the "$+$ More settings" link so you can see the Scale setting.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link i/printing-2.png %})

Set the scale down to 80%, or whatever suits your fancy. Then print the article to paper. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link i/printing-3.png %})

If you want to create a .pdf file, change the print destination to "pdf file". Then continue on to pick a file name for your .pdf file.
![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link i/printing-4.png %})
