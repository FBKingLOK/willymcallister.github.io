### Where we're headed 
{:.no_toc}

* We explore the derivative form and integral form of the inductor $i$-$v$ equation:

$v = \text L\,\dfrac{di}{dt}\qquad$ and $\quad \displaystyle i = \dfrac1{\text L}\, \int_{\,0}^{\,T} v\,\text dt + i_0$

* We create simple circuits by connecting an inductor to a current source, a voltage source, and a switch. 

* We learn why an inductor acts like a short circuit if its current is constant.

* We learn why the current in an inductor cannot change instantaneously.

* When an inductor is connected to a switch, there is a paradox when the switch is thrown open. Where does the inductor current go? 

* We show how to protect sensitive components from high voltages generated by an inductor.

## Inductor $i$-$v$ equations

$v = \text L\,\dfrac{di}{dt}\quad$ and $\quad\displaystyle i = \dfrac1{\text L}\, \int_{\,0}^{\,T} v\,\text dt + i_0$    

These are the derivative form and integral form of the inductor  equations.

$\text L$ is the *inductance*, a physical property of the inductor.  
$\text L$ is the scale factor for the relationship between $v$ and $di/dt$.  
$\text L$ determines how much $v$ gets generated for a given amount of $di/dt$.  
$i_0$ is the initial current flowing in the inductor, at $t=0$.

<p>$d$ is calculus notation for 'differential', or "a tiny change in ...". For example, $dt$ means 'a tiny change in time'. When you see it in a ratio, like $di/dt$, that means, "a tiny change in $i$ (current) for each tiny change in time" An expression like $di/dt$ is called a <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-derivative-intro/ab-defining-derivative/v/calculus-derivatives-1-new-hd-version">derivative</a>. This derivative is the slope of current when it is plotted against time.</p>

<p>The loopy $\int$ symbol is also from calculus. It is an <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-antiderivatives-ftc/ab-antiderivatives-intro/v/antiderivatives-and-indefinite-integrals">integral</a> sign. It's meaning is similar to the summation symbol $\Sigma$. In the inductor equation, the integral sign means you add up the voltage at every tiny interval of time, $dt$, starting at time $t=0$ and stopping at time $t=T$. Integration is the opposite of taking the derivative.</p>

## Inductor voltage is proportional to *change* of current

When we learned about resistors, Ohm's Law told us the voltage across a resistor is proportional to the current through the resistor: $v = i\,\text R$. 

Now we have an inductor with its $i$-$v$ equation: $v = \text L\,\dfrac{di}{dt}$.

This tells us the voltage across the inductor is proportional to the *change* of current through the inductor. 

For real-world resistors, we learned to take care that voltage and current don't get too big for the physical resistor to handle. 
For real-world inductors, we have to be careful the voltage and *change of current* don't get too big for the physical inductor to handle. This can be tricky, since it is very easy to create a very big change of current if you open or close a switch. Later on in this article we show how to design for this situation.

## Inductor and current source

The first thing we'll look at is an inductor connected to an ideal current source.

The current source provides a constant current to the inductor, $i = \text I$, for example, $i = 2 \,\text{mA}$. 

**What is the voltage across the inductor?** 

The inductor equation tells us:

$v = \text L\,\dfrac{di}{dt}$

This says the voltage across an inductor is proportional to the rate of change of the current through the inductor.

Since the current source provides a constant current, the rate of change, or slope, of the current is $0$. 

$\dfrac{di}{dt} = \dfrac{d2}{dt} = 0\qquad$ (everybody knows $2$ doesn't change with time)

Therefore, the voltage across the inductor is: 

$v = \text L\cdot 0$  

$v = 0$

*If a constant current flows in an inductor, then $di/dt = 0$, so there is zero voltage across the inductor.* 

*Zero voltage means an inductor with constant current looks like a short circuit, the same as a plain wire.*

Even if the current really big, like $100\,\text A$, if it is constant, the voltage across the inductor is still $0$ volts.

## Inductor and voltage source

Now let's connect an inductor to an ideal constant voltage source and see what the inductor equation tells us.

Let's be specific and say $\text V = 3\,\text V$ and $\text L = 10\,\text{mH}$. 

![](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/a276a0e7a21337ca28b29f25c3c53021b714baf2.svg){: .centered :}{: height="200px"}

If we plug these values into the inductor equation we get:

$v = \text L\,\dfrac{di}{dt}$

$3 = 10 \,\text{mH} \cdot \dfrac{di}{dt}$

or, solving for $di/dt$:

$\dfrac{di}{dt}= \dfrac{3}{10 \times 10^{-3}} = 300 \,\text{amperes}/\text{sec}$

That means the current through the inductor will have a rising slope of $300\,\text{amperes}/\text{second}$.

That is pretty amazing, but that's what the equation predicts. Needless to say, this is not a practical circuit. We just constructed it in our heads so we could see what happens with a constant voltage. If we build this circuit the current would ramp up until our real-world voltage source couldn't keep up with the demand for more current. But over a short time span, this is how real inductors work.

*A constant voltage across an inductor results in a current with a constant slope.*

<summary>analogy to mass</summary>
<p>Inductance is analogous to mass or inertia in a mechanical system. The energy in the magnetic field of an inductor doesn't allow the current to change instantaneously, just like the mass of the car tends to resist changes in velocity. A car cannot be stopped or started instantaneously. An inductor is basically the electrical version of Newton's First Law of Motion (also called the Law of Inertia): A body in motion tends to stay in motion.</p>

*The current in an inductor does not (will not) change instantaneously.*




## Summary
{:.no_toc}

The current in an inductor does not change instantaneously.

When its current is constant, an inductor looks like a short circuit.

Be careful making circuits with an inductor. A sudden changed in current, like a switch thrown open, breaking a current path, that means the derivative of current, $di/dt$, can become very large. The inductor equation tells us there can be a large voltage generated across the inductor. 

One way to deal with potentially destructive inductor voltage is to design a path for the current, so you don't get a large $di/dt$. We showed how to add a diode to provide a current path and clamp the inductor voltage to an acceptable value  when a switch was thrown open.
