Your study of Electricity begins with the concept of *charge*. We take a look into what this means. We also talk about the unit of charge, the *coulomb*. The relationship between the electron charge and a coulomb of charge can be a little fuzzy, so we will talk about that, too.

I want to start at the very beginning, like 5000 years ago. For the moment, pretend you never heard the words charge or electricity, and forget you know about atoms and electrons and protons. 

Around 5000 years ago, the Egyptians knew that if you touched an eel it could give you a shock. They didn't know why it happened, but they used to tell sick people to touch eels to make them feel better. This very first practical application of electricity was in medicine.

Back in those days, the Greeks made jewelry out of a pretty stone called amber. Amber isn't really a stone, it is fossilized resin from trees. Resin is a goopy substance trees make as a defense mechanism to fight off insects and cover wounds like when a branch gets broken. When this goopy stuff drips from the tree it might eventually turn solid and get the name amber. It is basically nature's version of plastic.

So Egyptian or Greek aristocrats wearing their amber jewelry would pet their cats. They noticed light things like feathers or cat hair or their own hair were attracted to the amber. Today we have a fancy word for it, the *triboelectric effect*. "Tribo-" is the Greek word for "rub", so you can call it the ["rubbing-electric" effect]({{ site.baseurl}}/v/triboelectric-effect.html). You can get the same effect yourself by running a plastic comb your dry hair or rubbing a balloon on your sweater.

The Greek word for amber is ἤλεκτρον. I bet you can guess what we use this word for.

## Charge is a property of matter

So we have observations of nature, like those I just described. We observe this wierd force between objects, either attraction or repulsion depending on what was rubbed against what. Wierdest of all, the force acts at a distance. The two objects are not touching, but yet we see this obvious pushing or pulling force existing between them. This is super strange. This rubbing force kind of resembles magnetism because of the force at a distance property. But it comes from a different place. Magnetism is a property of certain kinds of rocks, called lodestones (a rock that contains iron). This amber-rubbing-cat force comes from the friction between amber and cat and has nothing to do with iron.

To figure out what seems to be going on, this is the best explanation anyone has come up with so far: Physical objects (matter) that seem to have or emit this force are said to possess a property we call **charge**.

<summary>What exactly is a "property" of matter? 
</summary>
<p>Matter has a number of properties: its mass, its color, its volume, its squishyness. These properties are not little things that are inside the matter, they are asects of the matter itself. When an object attracts or repels other nearby objects we say it is because it has some *charge*.

To this day, we have no idea why this force exists, or how it comes about. We don't even know if charge really exists, or it is just some story we made up so we can feel like we know what's going on. And the whole explanation about "acting at a distance" never made anyone very happy or confident. The only thing we are certain of is that the force is for sure there, and we've come up with all sorts of cool things we can do with it. That is what an electrcial engineer does.


The source of this force has been given the name **charge**. A very noticeable thing about electric force is that it is large, far greater than the force of gravity. Unlike gravity, however, there are two types of electric charge. Opposite types of charge attract, and like types of charge repel. Gravity has only one type: it only attracts, never repels.


## Coulomb
from KA learner ccmiint
First lets look at the coulomb then we will look at the ampere. Because electrons are so small and it would be difficult to measure individually, we have put 6.28 billion billion electrons into a unit called a coulomb. I like to think of it as a gallon of water. There are a lot of individual water molecules in a gallon, and you could imagine it would be impossible to measure water by molecules. So a gallon is just a convenient, and a standard measurement of all those billions of individual water molecules just like the coulomb is for electrons. And the ampere is a rate which is equal to 1 coulomb per second or 6.28 billion billion electrons moving past a point per second. So in terms of water, one gallon of water moving past a point per second.

* The charge on an electron is a tiny unwieldy number. $0.00000000000000000016021766208$ coulombs. Rather than writing all those zeros—and getting it wrong most of the time—we can use scientific notation to write the number more simply: $1.6021766208 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs.

<summary> What is a coulomb?</summary>
<p>The <b>coulomb</b> is the Système International d'Unités (SI) unit for an amount of charge. $1$ coulomb of charge flows past a point in a wire in one second when the current in the wire is $1$ ampere.
$1 \,\text{coulomb} = 1 \,\text{ampere flowing for} \, 1 \,\text{second}$</p>

<p>In terms of electrons, $e^-$, one coulomb is the combined charge of $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.
