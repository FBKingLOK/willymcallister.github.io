Your study of Electricity begins with the concept of *charge*. We take a look into what this means. We also talk about the unit of charge, the *coulomb*. The relationship between the electron charge and a coulomb of charge can be a little fuzzy, so we will talk about that, too.

## Amber

I want to start at the very beginning, like 5000 years ago. For the moment, pretend you never heard the words charge or electricity, and forget you know about atoms and electrons and protons. 

Around 5000 years ago, the Egyptians knew that if you touched an eel it could give you a shock. They didn't know why it happened, but they used to tell sick people to touch eels to make them feel better. This very first practical application of electricity was in medicine.

Back in those days, the Greeks made jewelry out of a pretty stone called amber. Amber isn't really a stone, it is fossilized resin from trees. Resin is a goopy substance trees make as a defense mechanism to fight off insects and cover wounds like when a branch gets broken. When this goopy stuff drips from the tree it might eventually turn solid and get the name amber. It is basically nature's version of plastic.

So Egyptian or Greek aristocrats wearing their amber jewelry would pet their cats. They noticed light things like feathers or cat hair or their own hair were attracted to the amber. Today we have a fancy word for it, the *triboelectric effect*. "Tribo-" is the Greek word for "rub", so you can call it the ["rubbing-electric" effect]({{ site.baseurl}}/v/triboelectric-effect.html). You can get the same effect yourself by running a plastic comb your dry hair or rubbing a balloon on your sweater.

The Greek word for amber is ἤ λ ε κ τ ρ ο ν.

I bet you can guess what we use this word for. 

## Making sense of it

So we have these observations of nature: rubbing cats or balloons. We observe this wierd force, either attraction or repulsion depending on what was rubbed against what. Wierdest of all, it seems like the force acts at a distance: The two objects don't have to be touching, but yet we see this obvious pushing or pulling force between them. This is super strange (and fascinating). 

<details>
<summary>Is rubbing cats the same as magnetism?</summary>
<p>This rubbing force seems kind of like magnetism, which has the same <em>force at a distance</em> property. But electric force has to come from a different place. Magnetism is a property of certain kinds of rocks called lodestones (a rock that contains iron). This electric force comes from the friction between amber and cat and has nothing to do with iron.

The best explanation anyone has come up with (so far) to explain what's happening here is: Physical objects (matter) that emit this force are said to possess a property we call **charge**. 

<details>
<summary>What exactly is a "property" of matter? 
</summary>
<p>Matter has a number of properties: its mass, color, volume, squishyness. These properties are not little things that are inside the matter, they are asects of the matter itself. When an object attracts or repels other nearby objects we say it is because it has the property of *charge*. Charge is not some little tiny piece of stuff tucked inside atomic particles, it is a property of those particles.

To this day, we have no idea why this rub-the-cat electric force exists, just like we don't know why gravity exists. It just does. We don't even know if charge is real, or just some story we made up to make us feel less dumb. And the whole "acting at a distance" thing never made anyone happy. However, we are certain this force exists, that's for sure, and we've come up with a good way to describe it. Best of all, we've come up with all sorts of cool things we can do with it. That is what electrcial engineers do.

Even if we can't explain *why* there is electric force, we can describe *what it does*. The first person to do a good job of that was French physicist [Charles Augustin de Coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles-Augustin_de_Coulomb), in 1784. 

Aside: The electron was discovered in 1897 by [J.J. Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron#Discovery) at Cambridge University. This is a good date to remember if you are interested in the history of electrical discoveries.

A very noticeable thing about electric force is that it is large, far greater than the force of gravity. Unlike gravity, however, there are two types of electric charge. Opposite types of charge attract, and like types of charge repel. Gravity has only one type: it only attracts, never repels.


## Coulomb
from KA learner ccmiint
First lets look at the coulomb then we will look at the ampere. Because electrons are so small and it would be difficult to measure individually, we have put 6.28 billion billion electrons into a unit called a coulomb. I like to think of it as a gallon of water. There are a lot of individual water molecules in a gallon, and you could imagine it would be impossible to measure water by molecules. So a gallon is just a convenient, and a standard measurement of all those billions of individual water molecules just like the coulomb is for electrons. And the ampere is a rate which is equal to 1 coulomb per second or 6.28 billion billion electrons moving past a point per second. So in terms of water, one gallon of water moving past a point per second.

* The charge on an electron is a tiny unwieldy number. $0.00000000000000000016021766208$ coulombs. Rather than writing all those zeros—and getting it wrong most of the time—we can use scientific notation to write the number more simply: $1.6021766208 \times 10^{-19}$ coulombs.

<summary> What is a coulomb?</summary>
<p>The <b>coulomb</b> is the Système International d'Unités (SI) unit for an amount of charge. $1$ coulomb of charge flows past a point in a wire in one second when the current in the wire is $1$ ampere.
$1 \,\text{coulomb} = 1 \,\text{ampere flowing for} \, 1 \,\text{second}$</p>

<p>In terms of electrons, $e^-$, one coulomb is the combined charge of $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons.
