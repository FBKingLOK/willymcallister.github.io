One of the most confusing ideas for beginning electrical engineers is *conventional current*. This topic gets by far the most questions and causes the greatest initial frustration when starting to learn about electricity. It often seems to new students to be either a cruel practical joke or some kind of continuing colossal mistake caused by engineering laziness.

## Typical question from a motivated learner

>Early on \[in class\] it was explained that there are two theories \[for current\]: conventional theory and electron theory. Conventional theory is the original belief that electricity flows from the positive side to the negative side of a battery. Electron theory is the opposite of that and what is explained in this video ([Current]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _videos/current.md %})). I was also told that electron theory was proved the correct out of the two; however, conventional theory is still the one used because "it works". 

>I don't understand though why when conventional theory was proved incorrect, it is still being used. It's a source of great confusion for me. Is it because the \[engineering\] world is just too lazy to make the transition from a false theory to a correct one? 

## Conventional current is not a "kind" of current

Conventional current is not an alternative "theory" of current, nor is it a "kind" of current. It is just a shared way of talking about current direction. 

The definition of current is short and simple, 

>Current is the movement of charge.

This simple definition gets interesting (and perhaps confusing) because there are two types of charge, and they move in opposite directions. If negative charge is moving right, then positive charge would be moving left. 

In addition, the instruments we use to measure current (ammeters) can't tell the difference between positive charge moving one way from negative charge moving the other way. An ammeter can only report a single number when it measures current, so it gives us one number for the combined amount of positive and negative charge moving around (see the [definition of current]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/basic-quantities.md %}#current)). 

Given we have two types of charge and the limitations of an ammeter, the convention (habit) we use to indicate current direction is to identify the direction positive charges are moving (even if no positive charge is present and moving). When we use this convention, the current arrow points in the direction negative charges (electrons) are *coming from*. 

## Other conventions for direction

We now know that current in wires is carried by electrons. Even so, the idea of conventional current direction is not "false" or "incorrect". It's just a habit, like our habit of holding maps with North at the top. North at the top isn't right or wrong, it's just a habit that everybody knows. We could all put South at the top, but we don't. The conventional direction for holding maps is North at the top.

Another convention is the way sailors identify the direction of the wind. If you are a brand new sailor and the Old Swab tells you, "Arrr matey, it's a West wind a'blowin today.", you might think the wind is blowing towards the west. You say, "Oh, the west wind will blow the ship farther west by lunchtime." That's a perfectly reasonable thing to conclude if you are sailing for the very first time. But the old swab says to you, "No, matey, the sailor's convention for wind direction is to say where the wind is *blowing from*." A West wind blows *from* the west, towards the east. 

A this point you could have one of two reactions, "Oh my! You're saying there are two kinds of wind! I'm so confused! Why do you use the wrong one?". Or you could say, "Oh, thanks for telling me, Old Swab. I'll see if I can work with that convention for wind direction. A west wind means we will have lunch farther east from here." 

## Advice

Rather than getting stuck trying to figure out what this all means, my advice is to move ahead and learn about Ohm's Law and resistor circuits. Ohm's Law is based on the conventional current direction. You can do resistor problems and get the right answer for voltage and current. Your answers will match what you measure with a multimeter. At the beginning, you can also envision how electrons move through a circuit. After just a few problems you will start to focus on conventional current direction and you will think less and less about electron current, I promise.

## Coincidences

This issue about the direction of current arises from some coincidences.

The first was how the electron got its negative sign $(-)$. This is Ben Franklin's contribution. Around the time of his kite/key/lightning experiment he published a theory of electricity that said electricity was made of a single invisible fluid. If you rubbed certain substances against each other (fur and glass rods), one of them gained extra fluid and the other lost or lacked fluid. The electron was discovered $150$ years later. Folks figured out the fluid-lacking material actually had an excess of electrons. That's how the electron got its minus sign.

Buried within the electron's sign is another coincidence. Franklin introduced the names "plus" and "minus" for the two types of charge. That's completely arbitrary. Those names make it seem like some kind of arithmetic is going on. Using names from arithmetic serves us well when combining charges. Opposite charges come together to give you something that's neutral (something that seems like "zero" charge). But there are lots of examples of opposites that are not based on arithmetic signs. On/off, up/down, North/South, red(go)/green(stop), left/right, light/dark. If you were taught, "The convention for the current arrow is to point in the direction the red charge moves", I think there would be far less anxiety surrounding current direction, even if green charge is what moves in metal wires. 

Scientists assign a single number to the movement of charge, since that's what our instruments report. The conventional habit was to track the movement of positive charge. Seems like an innocent choice; who doesn't like positive things? Electrons happen to be negative, and they are what's moving in most electronic circuits. Does it matter? Should we turn everything around? Naa. This only bugs new students for a week or two, and crabby old engineers who complain about everything.

## Franklin gave us a gift

In the end, I think Franklin's "mistake" is no mistake at all. It's actually a gift to every engineer and engineering student. It means we really have to understand and appreciate the nature of charge and current.
