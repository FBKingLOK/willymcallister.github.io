Welcome to Spinning Numbers. The topics covered here are what you might be taught as an undergraduate in electrical engineering. I try to talk to you as a good friend who wants to help you understand these beautiful ideas. I started learning about electricity when I was about twelve years old. My first sense of wonder came from a tube radio. This warm little box played music sent with invisible waves from miles away. Are you kidding me! How great is that! I was hooked. Here was this amazing invention that came from the minds of humans. Count me in.

I remember how hard was to grasp the ideas of electricity. After I graduated form college and started my career, every few years I would have to go back to study the fundamentals I needed for a new project. Years into my job there were moments where I would slap my head and say, "So *that's* what that means!" I hope these videos and articles help you to have similar Aha! moments, but without the long years in between.

This material has its roots in my time at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering) in 2015-16 when I was the Content Fellow for Electrical Engineering. This site has links to the YouTube videos I created while at KA, the same videos you see on the KA site. The articles you find here at Spinning Numbers were copied over from KA, and I've been improving them based on questions from other learners.

### Circuit sandbox
A special feature here at Spinning Numbers is the [Circuit sandbox](/a/circuit-sandbox.html) simulator, where you can try out your own design ideas. This is something I wanted to make available on Khan Academy but the time wasn't avaialable until now. 

Starting in 2017, I will be adding new introductory and advanced material and continue to update articles based on questions from learners. This is all a labor of love. 

### Creating the site

This site is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/willymcallister) and is generated by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the '[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)' theme. 

Comments for this static web site are implemented with [Staticman](https://staticman.net/), with protection from robots using [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/).  

Equations are rendered by [$\KaTeX$](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), the super-fast math typesetting library from Khan Academy. 

Animations like the one above are created with [D3.js](http://d3js.org).

### Acknowledgements

I'm grateful to Sal Khan and everyone at Khan Academy for an inspiring vision: A free world-class education for anyone, anywhere.
