Learn the concepts of electrical engineering. The topics covered here are what you might be taught as an undergraduate in electrical engineering. The tone I try to achieve is that of a good friend who wants to explain these beautiful ideas in a clear and understandable way. I started learning about electricity when I was twelve years old. I remember how hard I worked and how confusing it was to grasp the ideas. So many times later in my career I slapped my head and said, "That's what that meant!" I hope to share explanations with you so you can have similar Aha! moments, but without years in between.

This material has its roots in my time at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering) in 2015-16 where I was the Content Fellow for Electrical Engineering. This site has links to the videos and articles I created while at KA. 

#### Circuit sandbox
A special feature of this site not available at KA is the [Circuit sandbox](/a/circuit-sandbox.html). where you can try out your own design ideas. 

Starting in 2017, I will be adding new material, both introductory and advanced. I will be revising articles based on questions from learners. This is all a labor of love. 

#### Creating the site

This static web site is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/willymcallister) and is generated by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The Jekyll theme is '[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)'. Comments are implemented with [Staticman](https://staticman.net/).  

Equations are rendered by [$\KaTeX$](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), the super-fast math typesetting library from Khan Academy.
