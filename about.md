Welcome to Spinning Numbers. The topics covered here are what you will find in an undergraduate electrical engineering course on circuits. My goal is to talk to you like a good friend who wants to help you understand these elegant ideas. 

I got interested electricity when I was about eight years old. My first sense of wonder came from a tube radio. This glowing little box played music sent on invisible waves from miles away. Are you kidding me! How great is that! Electricity is invisible, and yet people understand it, and can invent radios and other great stuff. I wanted to understand, too.

In college my major was electrical engineering. After graduating I started my career designing integrated circuits and computers. For each new project I would go back to my textbooks to re-study the fundamentals I needed. There were moments where I would slap my head and say, "So *that's* what my teacher meant!" I hope these videos and articles help you to have similar head-slapping *Aha!* moments, but without the long years in between.

The videos and articles you find here started life when I was at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering) in 2015-16. I was the Content Fellow for Electrical Engineering. Sal and the other content creators taught me how to approach teaching in the KA style.

I have been adding new material and improving the articles I wrote for KA based on questions from  learners, and writing new articles as well. The video links go to the same videos you see on the KA EE site. It's is all a labor of love.

### Circuit sandbox

Circuit simulation is a critical tool for all engineers. A special feature here at Spinning Numbers is the [Circuit sandbox](/a/circuit-sandbox.html) simulator. You can study circuits and try out your own ideas. The simulator is something I wanted to make available on Khan Academy but didn't have the time during my fellowship. 

### Creating the site

This site is saved at [GitHub](https://github.com/willymcallister/spinningnumbers), hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The site is generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the '[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)' theme. [Github](https://github.com/willymcallister/willymcallister.github.io)

The articles are written in Jekyll's [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/documentation.html) superset of Markdown. 

Equations are rendered by [$\KaTeX$](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), the super-fast math typesetting library from Khan Academy.

Drawings of circuits and other images come from Adobe Illustrator and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). 

Animated images and computed graphs are created with [D3.js](http://d3js.org). The source code for animations and graphs are in the [/assets/d3 folder](https://github.com/willymcallister/spinningnumbers/tree/master/assets/d3).

Videos are drawn in [Sketchbook Pro](https://www.sketchbook.com/). The screen and audio are captured and edited in [Camtasia](https://www.techsmith.com/video-editor.html). I use a Wacom Bamboo tablet, and a [Sampson USB microphone](http://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/usb-microphones/c03u/).
