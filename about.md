Learn the concepts of electrical engineering. The topics covered here are what you would be taught as an undergraduate majoring in electrical engineering.

This material has its roots in my time at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering) in 2015-16 where I was the Content Fellow for Electrical Engineering. This site has copies of the articles and videos I created for Khan Academy. You will also find a circuit simulator [Circuit sandbox](/a/circuit-sandbox.html), where you can try out your own design ideas. 

Starting in 2017, I will be adding new material, both introductory and advanced, as well as revising articles based on questions from learners. This is all a labor of love, so please be patient.

#### Creating the site

This web site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the site.  
The Jekyll theme is '[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)'.

Equations are rendered by [$\KaTeX$](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), the super-fast math typesetting library from Khan Academy.
