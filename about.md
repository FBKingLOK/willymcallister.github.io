Welcome to Spinning Numbers. The topics covered here are what you might be taught as an undergraduate in electrical engineering. I try to talk to you as a good friend who wants to help you understand these beautiful ideas. 

I became interested electricity when I was about eight years old. My first sense of wonder came from a tube radio. This warm little box played music sent on invisible waves from miles away. Are you kidding me! How great is that! Radio is this amazing invention that came from the minds of people. Electricity is pretty much invisible, and yet people understand it. I wanted to understand, too.

In college my major was electrical engineering. After graduation I started my career designing integrated circuits and computers. For each new project I would go back to my textbooks to re-study the fundamentals I needed. There were moments where I would slap my head and say, "So *that's* what that means!" I hope these videos and articles help you to have similar Aha! moments, but without the long years in between.

This material has its roots in my time at [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering) in 2015-16 when I was the Content Fellow for Electrical Engineering. 

Starting in 2017, I will be adding new introductory and advanced material. This site currently has links to YouTube videos I created while at KA, the same videos you see on the KA site. The articles you find here at Spinning Numbers started at KA, and I've been improving them based on questions from  learners, and writting new articles as well. This is all a labor of love.

### Circuit sandbox
A special feature here at Spinning Numbers is the [Circuit sandbox](/a/circuit-sandbox.html) simulator, where you can try out your own design ideas. The simulator is something I wanted to make available on Khan Academy but didn't have the time until now. Simulation is such a critical tool for all engineers.

### Creating the site

This site is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/willymcallister/spinningnumbers) and is generated by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the '[minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)' theme. 

Equations are rendered by [$\KaTeX$](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/), the super-fast math typesetting library from Khan Academy. 

Animated images are created with [D3.js](http://d3js.org). The source code for my animations is on [github](https://github.com/willymcallister/spinningnumbers/tree/master/assets/d3).
