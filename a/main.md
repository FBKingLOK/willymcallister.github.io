## Preparing to study electrical engineering
Become familiar with the two most important electrical quantities: current and voltage. Learn about engineering numbers, units, and notation. Read a summary of the math and science preparation that will help you have the best experience studying electrical engineering.

## Circuit analysis
Circuit analysis is the process of finding all the currents and voltages in a network of connected components. We look at the basic elements used to build circuits, and find out what happens when elements are connected together into a circuit.

### Circuit elements
The basic elements of circuit design are components (resistors, capacitors, and inductors), and sources (voltage and current). We talk about both ideal elements and real-world objects. We develop precise terminology for how to talk about circuits.

### Circuits with resistors
Series and parallel resistors, delta-wye networks, and the voltage divider.

### DC circuit analysis
Find the state of a DC circuit by applying Kirchhoff's Laws. The node voltage method, mesh current method, and loop current method.

### Natural and forced response
Circuits with capacitors and inductors change with time. The natural and forced response of RC, RL, and RLC circuits. Uses calculus.

### AC circuit analysis
If we limit ourselves to signals shaped like sines or cosines, we can develop a whole method of AC analysis to figure out what happens in circuits with any changing signal. These methods are far simpler than solving a differential equation from scratch.
