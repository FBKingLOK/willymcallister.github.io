Here are some tips on how to print an article or generate a .pdf file.

The articles print nicely straight out of your browser.

<p>Before you print, decide if you want all the hidden hints and side comments to print. Open them all up by clicking the blue triangles in the article, and then go ahead with printing.</p>

You probably want to reduce the print scale down to around 80% of full size to get a nice result. Start by setting the scale to 80%. You do this in your browser's File: Print dialog box.

### Example: Mac running the Chrome browser

This is what the Print dialog box looks like on my Mac running the Chrome browser. Your browser will have something similar.

The Print dialog opens like this. The default scale is 100%. At this scale, the article prints a little too big and takes more paper than it needs to.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link i/printing-1.png %})

Open the "$+$ More settings" link so you can see the Scale setting.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link i/printing-2.png %})

Set the scale down to 80%, or whatever suits your fancy. Then choose the number of pages you want. You may want to cut off the comment section or include it. Print the article to paper.

If you want a .pdf file, change the print destination to "pdf file". Continue on with Save and pick a file name for your .pdf file.
