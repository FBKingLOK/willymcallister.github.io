The Node Voltage Method solves circuits with the minimum number of KCL equations. 

The steps of the Node Voltage Method are,  

1. Assign a reference node (ground).
1. Assign node voltage names.
1. Solve the nodes with a voltage source connected to the reference node.
1. Write Kirchhoff's Current Law for each node.
1. Solve the resulting system of equations.
