Special case for when we have just two resistors in parallel:  
When two resistors are in parallel, the equivalent resistance is the product of the two resistors divided by their sum. 

When the two resistors have the same value, the equivalent parallel resistance is exactly half of the original resistance. Created by Willy McAllister.
