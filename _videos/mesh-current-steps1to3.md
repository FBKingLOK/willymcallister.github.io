We solve a circuit by writing Kirchhoff's Voltage Law in terms of *mesh currents*. This video covers the first three steps of the Mesh Current Method.

The steps of the Mesh Current Method are,

1. Identify the meshes (the open windows of a circuit).
1. Assign a current variable to each mesh, using a consistent direction.
1. Write Kirchhoff's Voltage Law around each mesh. 
1. Solve the resulting system of equations.
1. Solve for individual element currents and voltages using Ohm's Law.
