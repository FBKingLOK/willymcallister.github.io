By convention, we say current flows in the direction a positive charge would move. That means electrons---with their negative charge---move in the opposite direction of the current arrow.

Military veterans: Some electronic training programs (for example the U.S. Navy [NEETS](http://www.hnsa.org/resources/manuals-documents/2575-2/) program in the 1960s) use the opposite convention, defining current to flow in the direction of electron motion. If you have this convention in your head it's challenging to follow along with the discussion here at Spinning Numbers. We follow the widely used SI convention for current direction.
