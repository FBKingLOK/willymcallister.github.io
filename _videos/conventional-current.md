By convention, we say current flows in the direction a positive charge would move. Electrons (with their negative charge) move in the opposite direction of the positive current arrow.

Veterans: Some military electronic training programs (for example the U.S. Navy [NEETS](http://www.hnsa.org/resources/manuals-documents/2575-2/) program in the 1960s) use the opposite convention, defining current to flow in the direction of electron motion, but we don't use that here at Spinning Numbers. We follow the SI convention for current direction.
