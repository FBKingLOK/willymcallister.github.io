The positive sign for current corresponds to the direction a positive charge would move. In metal wires, current is carried by negatively charged electrons, so the positive current arrow points in the opposite direction the electrons move. This has been the sign convention for 270 years, ever since Ben Franklin named electric charges with + and - signs. This convention came about 150 years before the discovery of the electron.
