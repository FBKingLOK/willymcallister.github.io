The ratio of a sinusoidal voltage to a sinusoidal current is called *impedance*. Impeadance is a generalization of the concept of resistance $(v/i)$. We derive the impedance of a resistor, inductor, and capacitor. The impedance of the inductor and capacitor includes a term for frequency, since the ratio of $(v/i)$ for these components depends on frequency.
