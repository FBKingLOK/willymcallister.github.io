# Spinning Numbers

This website emerges from my work at Khan Academy in 2016 where I was the Electrical Engineering Content Fellow. Articles and videos in the Khan Academy style, covering electrical engineering as taught at the undergraduate level for EE majors.

The shiny new feature of Spinning Numbers that distinguishes it from [Khan Academy's EE topic](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering) is this simple circuit simulator:

The collection of articles and vidos is growing. 

* Introduction to the two most important electrical quantities: current and voltage. 

* A first look at engineering numbers, units, and notation. 

* A summary of the math and science preparation that will help you have the best experience studying electrical engineering.

* Circuit elements - The basic elements of circuit design are components (resistors, capacitors, and inductors), and sources (voltage and current), ideal elements and real-world components.

* Circuits with resistors - Series and parallel resistors, delta-wye networks, and the voltage divider.

Here's what's coming soon...

* DC circuit analysis - Find the state of a DC circuit by applying Kirchhoff's Laws. The node voltage method, mesh current method, and loop current method.

* Natural and forced response - Circuits with capacitors and inductors change with time. The natural and forced response of RC, RL, and RLC circuits. Uses calculus.

* AC circuit analysis - We develop a new method of AC analysis (complex exponentials) to analyze circuits with any changing signal. These methods are far simpler than solving a differential equation from scratch.
