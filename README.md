# Spinning Numbers

## Introduction
Become familiar with the two most important electrical quantities: current and voltage. Get a first look at engineering numbers, units, and notation. Read a summary of the math and science preparation that will help you have the best experience studying electrical engineering.

## Circuit elements
The basic elements of circuit design are components (resistors, capacitors, and inductors), and sources (voltage and current). We talk about both ideal elements and real-world objects. We develop precise terminology for how to talk about circuits.

## Circuits with resistors
Series and parallel resistors, delta-wye networks, and the voltage divider.

## DC circuit analysis
Find the state of a DC circuit by applying Kirchhoff's Laws. The node voltage method, mesh current method, and loop current method.

## Natural and forced response
Circuits with capacitors and inductors change with time. The natural and forced response of RC, RL, and RLC circuits. Uses calculus.

## AC circuit analysis
If we limit ourselves to signals shaped like sines or cosines, we can develop a whole method of AC analysis to figure out what happens in circuits with any changing signal. These methods are far simpler than solving a differential equation from scratch.

This circuit simulator is the shiny new feature that distinguishes this web site from the Khan Academy EE topic.
