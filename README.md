# Spinning Numbers

This website started from my time at Khan Academy as the Electrical Engineering Content Fellow in 2016. - Willy McAllister

Articles and videos in the Khan Academy style, covering electrical engineering as taught at the undergraduate level for EE majors, covering (eventually):

* Introduction to the two most important electrical quantities: current and voltage. Get a first look at engineering numbers, units, and notation. Includes a summary of the math and science preparation that will help you have the best experience studying electrical engineering.

* Circuit elements
The basic elements of circuit design are components (resistors, capacitors, and inductors), and sources (voltage and current), ideal elements and real-world components.

* Circuits with resistors
Series and parallel resistors, delta-wye networks, and the voltage divider.

* DC circuit analysis
Find the state of a DC circuit by applying Kirchhoff's Laws. The node voltage method, mesh current method, and loop current method.

* Natural and forced response
Circuits with capacitors and inductors change with time. The natural and forced response of RC, RL, and RLC circuits. Uses calculus.

* AC circuit analysis
We can develop a whole method of AC analysis to figure out what happens in circuits with any changing signal. These methods are far simpler than solving a differential equation from scratch.

## Tools

This circuit simulator is the shiny new feature of Spinning Numbers that distinguishes this web site from [Khan Academy's EE topic](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/electrical-engineering).
