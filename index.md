These videos and articles began at Khan Academy where I had the honor of being the Electrical Engineering Content Fellow in 2016. The concepts are explained at the level of an undergraduate EE student. Motivated middle school and high school students can get a lot from the course. 

Spinning Numbers web site came to life in 2016 after I completed my fellowship at KA. All the articles have been reviewed and significantly improved, and several new articles have made their appearance. A nice new feature is the Circuit Sandbox simulator. Many articles include simulation models to let you try your test your understanding and bring the concepts to life. 

Good luck on your journey into electronics and electrical engineering. Please leave a comment if you enjoy your visit, and ask questions. I'm here to help.
