### [Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-introduction.md %})
Become familiar with the most important electrical quantities: charge, current, and voltage.

### [Circuit elements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-circuit-elements.md %})
Circuits are made of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and power sources.

### [Resistor circuits]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-resistor-circuits.md %})
Resistors in series and parallel, the voltage divider, delta-wye resistor networks.

### [DC circuit analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-dc-analysis.md %})
Kirchhoff's Laws, node voltage method, mesh and loop current methods. 

### [Special topics in DC analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-dc-analysis-special.md %})
Linearity and superposition. Source transformation. Thévenin and Norton equivalents.

### [Natural and forced response]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-natural-and-forced-response.md %})
Natural response is what a circuit does with its own internal stored energy.  

### [AC circuit analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-ac-analysis.md %})
If we limit signals to only sine waves, we get AC analysis based on complex exponentials. 

### [Amplifiers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-amplifiers.md %})
The operational amplifier is the building block of analog electronics.

Using a diode in a circuit.

### [Electrostatics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-electrostatics.md %})  
The force between charged objects is described by Coulomb's Law.

### [Everything]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/everything.md %})
A list of [everything]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/everything.md %}) on Spinning Numbers. Topics, articles, videos, images, and on and on.

### [Printing]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link printing.md %})  
Some tips on the best way to [print]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link printing.md %}) articles from Spinning Numbers.

### [The name <img class="sn-logo" src="/i/sn_logo2.svg">]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %})     
Where does the name [Spinning Numbers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %}) come from?

These videos and articles began at Khan Academy where I had the honor of being the Electrical Engineering Content Fellow in 2016. The concepts are explained at the level of an undergraduate EE student. Motivated middle school and high school students can get a lot from the course. 

I set up this Spinning Numbers web site after completing my KA fellowship. I've reviewed and significantly improved all the articles, and added several new articles. A nice new feature is the Circuit Sandbox simulator. You will find simulation models included in most articles, to let you try your hand and bring the concepts to life. 

Good luck as you learn about electronics and electrical engineering. Please leave a comment if you enjoy your visit, and ask questions. I'm here to help.
