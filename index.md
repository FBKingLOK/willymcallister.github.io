Welcome to Spinning Numbers! Learn about the world of electricity and electrical engineering. The concepts are taught at the level of an undergraduate EE student.  

### [Circuit sandbox]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %})
The shiny new feature of Spinning Numbers is a circuit simulator, the [Circuit sandbox]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %}).  
Run the [Circuit sandbox in English](http://spinningnumbers.org/circuit-sandbox/index.html) or [Circuit sandbox en Espa√±ol](http://spinningnumbers.org/circuit-sandbox/index-es.html). 

### [Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/topic-introduction.md %})
Become familiar with the most important electrical quantities: charge, current and voltage.

### [Circuit elements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/topic-circuit-elements.md %})
Circuits are made of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and voltage and sources.

### [Circuits with resistors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/topic-resistor-circuits.md %})
Resistors in series and parallel, delta-wye networks, and the voltage divider.

### [What's with the name?]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %})

Where does the name [Spinning Numbers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %}) come from? <img class="sn-logo" src="/i/sn_logo2.svg" alt="logo"> 

### [New]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/topic-new.md %})
Here's a list of [new material]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/topic-new.md %}) created for Spinning Numbers you won't find on KA.

### [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/topic-FAQ.md %})
A collection of interesting questions and answers about electrical topics.


## Coming soon

### Basic circuit analysis
Find the state of a DC circuit using Kirchhoff's Laws. The node voltage method, mesh current method, and loop current method.

### Circuits with capacitors and inductors
Natural and forced response of RC, RL, and RLC circuits. This is where we start to use calculus.

### AC circuit analysis
We confine signals to only sine waves, and then develop an analysis method using complex exponentials. These methods are much simpler than solving differential equations from scratch.
