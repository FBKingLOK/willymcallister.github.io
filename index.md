Welcome to Spinning Numbers! Learn about the world of electricity and electrical engineering. This work began at Khan Academy where I was the Electrical Engineering Content Fellow in 2016. 

## Circuit sandbox

The shiny new feature of Spinning Numbers is the [**Circuit sandbox**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %}).

Check out [Circuit sandbox in English](https://willymcallister.github.io/Circuit-sandbox/index.html) or you can try [Circuit sandbox en Espa√±ol](https://willymcallister.github.io/Circuit-sandbox/index-es.html). 

## Get started!
I'm adding links to KA YouTube videos and adding/improving articles as fast as I can. The introduction sequence is ready to go.

### [Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/introduction.md %})
Become familiar with the most important electrical quantities: charge, current and voltage. Get a first look at engineering numbers, units, and notation. Read a summary of the math and science preparation that will help you have the best experience studying electrical engineering.

### [What's with the name?]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %})

Where does the name [Spinning Numbers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %}) come from?

## Coming soon

#### Circuit elements
The basic elements of circuit design are components: resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and sources: voltage and current. We talk about ideal and real-world elements. We develop a precise vocabulary for how to talk about circuits and schematics.

#### Circuits with resistors
Resistors in series and parallel, delta-wye networks, and the voltage divider.

#### DC circuit analysis
Learn Kirchhoff's Laws and the methods of circuit analysis: node voltage, mesh current, and loop current methods.

#### Natural and forced response
Circuits with capacitors and inductors change with time. The natural and forced response of RC, RL, and RLC circuits. This is where we start to use calculus.

#### AC circuit analysis
If we limit ourselves to signals shaped like sines, a whole method of AC analysis emerges. We'll be able to figure out what happens in circuits with *any* signal. AC methods are far simpler than solving a differential equation from scratch.

#### Tools

[Circuit sandbox]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %}) is a simulator for modeling circuits.
