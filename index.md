Welcome to Spinning Numbers! You are about to learn about the world of electricity and electrical engineering. This is based on work I did while at Khan Academy as the Electrical Engineering Content Fellow in 2016. 

## Circuit sandbox

[![Circuit sandbox screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link i/42screenshot.png %}){: .centered }{:height="200px"}](https://willymcallister.github.io/Circuit-sandbox/index.html)

The big new feature here is the CIRCUIT SANDBOX. Here's how it works: [Circuit sandbox]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %}). This is a simple simulator you can use as a study aid as you progress through the videos and articles, and you can model your own designs as well. Please check it out. [Circuit sandbox in English](https://willymcallister.github.io/Circuit-sandbox/index.html) or you can use the [Circuit sandbox en Espa√±ol](https://willymcallister.github.io/Circuit-sandbox/index-es.html).

There is no installation, just click and start drawing a circuit. You can save your work and share it with others by sending a url. 

## Get started
I'm working on providing links to YouTube videos and revised/improved articles. For now, here is the introduction to electrical engineering.

### [Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/introduction.md %})
Become familiar with the most important electrical quantities: charge, current and voltage. Get a first look at engineering numbers, units, and notation. Read a summary of the math and science preparation that will help you have the best experience studying electrical engineering.

## Coming soon

### Circuit elements
The basic elements of circuit design are components: resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and sources: voltage and current. We talk about ideal and real-world elements. We develop a precise vocabulary for how to talk about circuits and schematics.

### Circuits with resistors
Resistors in series and parallel, delta-wye networks, and the voltage divider.

### DC circuit analysis
Learn Kirchhoff's Laws and the methods of circuit analysis: node voltage, mesh current, and loop current methods.

### Natural and forced response
Circuits with capacitors and inductors change with time. The natural and forced response of RC, RL, and RLC circuits. This is where we start to use calculus.

### AC circuit analysis
If we limit ourselves to signals shaped like sines, a whole method of AC analysis emerges. We'll be able to figure out what happens in circuits with *any* signal. AC methods are far simpler than solving a differential equation from scratch.

## Tools

[Circuit sandbox]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %}) is a simulator for modeling circuits.
