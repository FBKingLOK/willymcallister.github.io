Welcome to Spinning Numbers! Learn about electricity and electrical engineering, explained at the level of an undergraduate EE student.  

### [Circuit sandbox <img class="sn-logo" src="/i/circuit-sandbox.png" alt="circuit sandbox" height="80px">]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %})

Spinning Numbers has a circuit simulator, the [Circuit sandbox]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %}).    
Run the Circuit sandbox [in English](http://spinningnumbers.org/circuit-sandbox/index.html) or [en Espa√±ol](http://spinningnumbers.org/circuit-sandbox/index-es.html). 

### [Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-introduction.md %})
Become familiar with the most important electrical quantities: charge, current, and voltage.

### [Circuit elements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-circuit-elements.md %})
Circuits are made of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and power sources.

### [Circuits with resistors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-resistor-circuits.md %})
Resistors in series and parallel, the voltage divider, delta-wye resistor networks.

### [DC circuit analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-dc-analysis.md %})
Figure out the currents and voltges in a DC circuit using Kirchhoff's Laws, node voltage method, mesh and loop current methods. Linearity and superposition.

### [Natural and forced response]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-natural-and-forced-response.md %})
Natural response is what a circuit does with its own internal stored energy.  
Forced response is what happens when you apply an external signal.  
Learn a trick for quickly sketching exponential waveforms.

### [Amplifiers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-amplifiers.md %})
The *operational amplifier* is the building block of analog electronics.

### [What's with the name?]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %})

Where does the name [Spinning Numbers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %}) come from? <img class="sn-logo" src="/i/sn_logo2.svg" alt="logo"> 

### [Everything]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/everything.md %})
Here's a list of [everything]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/everything.md %}) on Spinning Numbers. Topic areas, articles, videos, images, etc.

## Coming soon

### AC circuit analysis
We limit signals to be only sine waves, and then develop an analysis method based on complex exponentials. This ends up being *much* simpler than solving differential equations from scratch every time.

These videos and articles got their start at Khan Academy where I was the Electrical Engineering Content Fellow in 2016. I hope you enjoy them.
