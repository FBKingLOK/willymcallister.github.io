Welcome to Spinning Numbers! Learn about the world of electricity and electrical engineering. The concepts are taught at the level of an undergraduate EE major just starting out. These videos and articles began at Khan Academy where I was the Electrical Engineering Content Fellow in 2016. 

### Circuit sandbox

The shiny new feature of Spinning Numbers is a simulator, the [Circuit sandbox]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %}).

Check out [Circuit sandbox in English](http://spinningnumbers.org/circuit-sandbox/index.html) or [Circuit sandbox en Espa√±ol](http://spinningnumbers.org/circuit-sandbox/index-es.html). 

## Get started!
I'm adding links to KA YouTube videos and making articles better as fast as I can. These are ready to go.

### [Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/topic-introduction.md %})
Become familiar with the most important electrical quantities: charge, current and voltage. Get a first look at engineering numbers, units, and notation. Read a summary of the math and science preparation that will help you have the best experience studying electrical engineering.

### [Circuit elements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/topic-circuit-elements.md %})
Circuits are made of components: resistors, capacitors, and inductors, and sources: voltage and current. Ideal and real-world elements. We develop a precise vocabulary for talking about circuits.

### [Circuits with resistors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/topic-resistor-circuits.md %})
Resistors in series and parallel, delta-wye networks, and the voltage divider.

### [What's with the name?]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %}) <img class="sn-logo" src="/i/sn_logo2.svg" alt="logo"> 

Where does the name [Spinning Numbers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %}) come from? 

### [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/topic-FAQ.md %})
Interesting questions and answers about electrical topics that need a home.


## Coming soon

### DC circuit analysis
Learn Kirchhoff's Laws and the methods of circuit analysis: node voltage, mesh current, and loop current methods.

### Natural and forced response
Circuits with capacitors and inductors change with time. The natural and forced response of RC, RL, and RLC circuits. This is where we start to use calculus.

### AC circuit analysis
If we limit ourselves to signals shaped like sines, a whole method of AC analysis emerges. We'll be able to figure out what happens in circuits with *any* signal. AC methods are far simpler than solving a differential equation from scratch.

### Tools

[Circuit sandbox]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %}) is a simulator for modeling circuits.
