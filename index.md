Welcome to Spinning Numbers! Learn about electricity and electrical engineering, explained at the level of an undergraduate EE student.  

### [Circuit sandbox <img class="sn-logo" src="/i/circuit-sandbox.png" alt="circuit sandbox" height="80px">]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/circuit-sandbox.md %})

Circuit sandbox is a simulator. Run it [in English](http://spinningnumbers.org/circuit-sandbox/index.html), [o en español](http://spinningnumbers.org/circuit-sandbox/index-es.html), [或简体中文](http://spinningnumbers.org/circuit-sandbox/index-zh.html) (Chinese).  
Help translate Circuit Sandbox into other languages. [It's easy!](a/circuit-sandbox.html#translation)

### [Introduction]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-introduction.md %})
Become familiar with the most important electrical quantities: charge, current, and voltage.

### [Circuit elements]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-circuit-elements.md %})
Circuits are made of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and power sources.

### [Resistor circuits]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-resistor-circuits.md %})
Resistors in series and parallel, the voltage divider, delta-wye resistor networks.

### [DC circuit analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-dc-analysis.md %})
Kirchhoff's Laws, node voltage method, mesh and loop current methods. 

### [Special topics in DC analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-dc-analysis-special.md %})
Linearity and superposition. Source transformation. Thévenin and Norton equivalents.

### [Natural and forced response]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-natural-and-forced-response.md %})
Natural response is what a circuit does with its own internal stored energy.  

### [AC circuit analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-ac-analysis.md %})
If we limit signals to only sine waves, we get AC analysis based on complex exponentials. 

### [Amplifiers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-amplifiers.md %})
The operational amplifier is the building block of analog electronics.

### [Semiconductors]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-semiconductors.md %}) 
Using a diode in a circuit.

### [Electrostatics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/topic-electrostatics.md %})  
The force between charged objects is described by Coulomb's Law.

### [Everything]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/everything.md %})
A list of [everything]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _topics/everything.md %}) on Spinning Numbers. Topics, articles, videos, images, and on and on.

Where does the name [Spinning Numbers]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %}) come from? [<img class="sn-logo" src="/i/sn_logo2.svg" alt="logo">]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _articles/whats-with-the-name.md %})

These videos and articles began at Khan Academy where I was the Electrical Engineering Content Fellow in 2016. Since completing my fellowship, I set up this web site and so far have reviewed and significantly improved all the articles. There are several new articles as well. A nice new feature of Spinning Numbers is the circuit simulator. Most articles include simulation models of the circuits to bring the concepts to life. 

I hope this site helps you learn about electronics and electrical engineering.
